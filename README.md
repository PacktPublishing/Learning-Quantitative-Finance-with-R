Once you've built this foundation, we'll dive into the practicalities of building financial models in R. This will help you have a fair understanding of the topics as well as their implementation, as the authors have presented some use cases along with examples that are easy to understand and correlate.

By the end of this book, you will have a firm grasp of the techniques required to implement basic quantitative finance models in R.

The code will look like the following:
          
        
        > y <- dnorm(Sampledata$Return, mean = mean(Sampledata$Return), 
        sd =sd(Sampledata$Return, na.rm = FALSE))
        > plot(Sampledata$Return,y)
